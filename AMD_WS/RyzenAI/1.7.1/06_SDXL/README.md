## 🎯 What is This?

**AMD SD Sandbox** is a framework for running Stable Diffusion (SD) models accelerated by **AMD Ryzen AI hardware**. It provides an easy-to-use interface for evaluating, comparing, and deploying multiple SD pipelines. When developing AI-powered applications with SD, developers face several challenges:

| 🚫 Problem | ✅ Solution |
|-----------|------------|
| **Model Selection Complexity** - Dozens of SD models exist, each with different capabilities and tradeoffs, requiring separate tools and interfaces | **Unified Pipeline Interface** - Run any supported SD model with consistent commands and a single orchestration framework |
| **Hardware Optimization Guesswork** - Need to compare NPU vs GPU vs CPU performance to justify hardware investments and optimize deployments | **Built-in Performance Benchmarking** - Automated profiling with CPU baseline comparison to measure real acceleration gains with the NPU |
| **Tedious Manual Testing** - Testing multiple prompts across multiple models requires repetitive manual work and scattered results | **Automated Batch Processing** - Test hundreds of prompts across multiple models automatically with organized result management |
| **Code Modification Barriers** - Official examples require source code changes for simple customizations like prompts or resolution | **No-Code Customization** - Configure everything via YAML files and CLI arguments without adjusting source code |

## 📜 Supported Models

The RAI 1.7.1 release of the sd-sandbox adds support for **auto-downloading models from Hugging Face** when a `model_id` is specified.

Here is a list of currently supported SD models. These models have had nodes replaced with custom ops specifically designed for AMD NPUs.

| Model | HF Model ID | Output Resolution | Text-To-Image | Image-To-Image | ControlNet |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| SD 1.5 | `amd/stable-diffusion-1.5-amdnpu` | 512x512 | ✅ | | | | | |
| SD Turbo | `amd/sd-turbo-amdnpu` | 512x512 | ✅ | | | | | |
| SD XL Base | `amd/sdxl-base-amdnpu` | 1024x1024 | ✅ | ✅ | | | | |
| SD XL Turbo | `amd/sdxl-turbo-amdnpu` | 512x512 | ✅ | | | | | |
| Segmind-Vega | `amd/segmind-vega-amdnpu` | 1024x1024 | ✅ | ✅ | | | | |
| **SD3 Medium** | `amd/stable-diffusion-3-medium-amdnpu` | 512–1024 | ✅ | | ✅ | 
| **SD3.5 Medium** | `amd/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium-amdnpu` | 512–1024 | ✅ | | ✅ |

### ControlNet Modes (SD3 / SD3.5)

The following ControlNet modes are supported for SD3 and SD3.5 models:

| Mode | Description | Control Image Required |
|------|-------------|:---:|
| Canny | Edge detection guided generation | ✅ |
| Tile | Tile-based image upscaling/enhancement | ✅ |
| Pose | Pose-guided human generation | ✅ |
| Depth | Depth map guided generation | ✅ |
| None | Text-to-image without ControlNet | |

### Dynamic Shape Support (SD3 / SD3.5)

SD3 and SD3.5 models support **dynamic shape inference**, allowing a single model to generate images at multiple resolutions without reloading. Supported resolutions are defined in [config/sd3_dynamic_shape.json](config/sd3_dynamic_shape.json) and include: 512×512, 512×768, 768×512, 576×1024, 1024×576, 768×1024, 1024×768, and 1024×1024.

## 🏞️ Image Generation Methods 

Here are some explanations of each of the SD methods. Note that pre- and post-processing padding and depadding are applied to the images where the resolutions do not match the model's inference resolution.

**🎨 Text-To-Image (T2I)** — Generate images from scratch using only text descriptions. Simply provide a prompt like "a mountain landscape at sunset" and the model creates a completely new image based on your description.
*Example use cases: concept art, marketing visuals, creative exploration, rapid prototyping*

<p align="center">• • •</p>

**🔄 Image-To-Image (I2I)** — Transform an existing image based on a text prompt while preserving certain structural or compositional elements. You provide both a reference image and a prompt, and the model generates a new image that follows the guidance of the input image while incorporating your text description.
*Example use cases: style transfer, image variations, artistic reinterpretation, photo enhancement*

## 🚀 Quick Start

#### Step 1: Install latest NPU Drivers and Ryzen AI SW

Follow the instructions here to download necessary NPU drivers and Ryzen AI SW: [Ryzen AI SW Installation Instructions](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html). Please allow for around **30 minutes** to install all of the necessary components of Ryzen AI SW.

#### Step 2: Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amd/sd-sandbox.git
cd sd-sandbox
```
#### Step 2: Copy `lib` directory

Copy the `lib` directory in `C:\Program Files\RyzenAI\1.7.1\GenAI-SD\lib` to the `sd-sandbox/` directory. This will allow the pipelines to find the necessary custom operator library for AMD NPU acceleration.


#### Step 3: Set Up Conda Environment

From step 1, the conda environment should already be installed. No modifications are needed to the conda environment for this release. Activate it with:
```powershell
conda activate ryzen-ai-1.7.1
```


####  Step 4: Download Models

Models are **auto-downloaded from Hugging Face** when you run a pipeline with a `model_id` specified in the YAML config. The models are expected to be cached locally in the directory named `models/` .

This directory needs to be created before running the pipelines

To use auto-download, ensure you have authenticated with Hugging Face (see Step 7). Models will be downloaded on first run and reused from cache on subsequent runs.


```powershell
# Create models directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "models" -Force
```

You can specify a `--revision` flag to select a specific branch, tag, or commit hash when downloading from Hugging Face (e.g., `--revision 1.7.1`).

#### Step 6: Configure Paths

Edit [config/pipeline_configs.yaml](config/pipeline_configs.yaml) to configure paths. The minimum required settings are:

1. The `onnx_custom_ops.dll` path:
```yaml
defaults:
  custom_op_path: "C:/Program Files/RyzenAI/1.7.1/deployment/onnx_custom_ops.dll"
```

2. Each pipeline needs a `model_id` for auto-download from Hugging Face, or a `--model_path` for locally stored models:

```yaml
pipelines:
  sd_15:
    model_ids:
      - "amd/stable-diffusion-1.5-amdnpu"
```

The `custom_op_path` can also be passed at the command line with `--custom-op-path`, or set per-pipeline in the YAML config.

More details on configurations can be found in the [Pipelines and Pipeline Groups Configuration](#-pipelines-and-pipeline-groups-configuration) section.

#### Step 7: Hugging Face Credentials

In order to access model files, you may need to visit the Hugging Face website and request access. 

1. For SD 3, you can visit https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers and request access.
2. Generate and copy your token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens. Select "Read access to contents of all repos under your personal namespace" and "Read access to contents of all public gated repos you can access" and then "Create token". 
3. Authenticate on your machine with:
```powershell
huggingface-cli login
```

In your output, you should see among other things:

```text
Login successful.
```

#### Step 8: Verify Installation

Verify that the main run script shows the possible pipelines and pipeline groups: 

```bash
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --list
```

You should see a list of all available pipelines and groups of pipelines similar to this:
```text
⚡ Automatic provider selection enabled
   • Will use best available: GPU > NPU > CPU
   • Available providers: DmlExecutionProvider, CPUExecutionProvider

==================================================

  all turbo    - sd_turbo, sd_turbo_bs1, sdxl_turbo, sdxl_turbo_bs1
...
```

You should now be able to run a pipeline with:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipelines sd_15
```

And get an output similar to:

```text

## 🧩 Pipelines and Pipeline Groups Configuration

Now that everything is installed, you are ready to configure and run SD pipelines. Pipelines are defined in the [config/pipeline_configs.yaml](config/pipeline_configs.yaml) configuration file and can be run via the main [scripts/run_pipelines.py](scripts/run_pipelines.py) script.

A pipeline is a complete SD workflow configuration that includes a specific model (e.g., SD 1.5, SDXL, SD 3.0), execution script, and parameters (resolution, inference steps, guidance scale). Each pipeline represents a single configured image generation setup, from text/image input to final image output.

Pipelines can be arranged into **groups** for common workflows (e.g., all SDXL models, all ControlNet models, etc.) to simplify running multiple pipelines at once. To create a pipeline group, simply list the desired pipelines under a group name in the [config/pipeline_configs.yaml](config/pipeline_configs.yaml) file.

### 📁 Config Directory

An overview of the directory structure that contains pipeline files and configurations is given below. The [config](config) directory contains two file types: [YAML](#yaml-files) and [JSON](#json-files).

#### YAML Files
YAML files define pipeline configurations, parameters, and execution settings. Here are the important YAML files:
- [config/pipeline_configs.yaml](config/pipeline_configs.yaml) - Default configuration file used by the framework
- [config/pipeline_configs_debug.yaml](config/pipeline_configs_debug.yaml) - Debug configuration with specialized settings
- `pipeline_custom_config.yaml` - If not using the default, custom YAML files can be used with the `--config` argument as below:
```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipelines sd_15 --config pipeline_custom_config.yaml
```

The [config/pipeline_configs.yaml](config/pipeline_configs.yaml) file has 3 main sections:
1. Global Pipeline Defaults
2. Pipeline Definitions
3. Pipeline Groups

**1. Global Pipeline Defaults**

Global defaults are defined at the top of the YAML file and are useful for setting parameters that apply to all pipelines, such as the output image resolution, or an external prompt file. The global defaults can always be overridden on a per-pipeline basis, by making a change to a variable in the pipeline definition.  

One example of setting a global default might be setting the `num_inference_steps` to 20. Every pipeline will use 20 inference steps unless overridden in the pipeline definition.

Some global parameters must be set to run any pipeline: the `models_path` where the models are located, the `test_path` directory containing the `run*.py` scripts, the `prompt_file` path where the prompts are located, and a `source_path` if setting up relative paths is desired.

**2. Pipeline Definitions**

Pipelines are defined in the YAML configuration file under the `pipelines` section. Each pipeline has its own set of parameters that can override the global defaults. Here are the pipeline definition parameters that must be present:

1. A unique name (e.g., `sd_15`, `sdxl_turbo`, `sd3_base`).
2. The base script associated with the pipeline (e.g., `run_sd.py`, `run_sd_xl.py`, `run_sd3.py`). 
3. Either a `model_id` for auto-download from Hugging Face, or a `--model_path` for locally stored models.

If nothing else is specified, default values will be used. However, almost all hyperparameters can be overridden on a per-pipeline basis.

In order to see all of the available parameters, the user can run `--help` on the python file specified in the `script` pipeline definition. All of these files are located in the `test/` directory. For example, to see all of the available parameters for the SDXL pipeline, you can run:

```powershell
python test/run_sd_xl.py --help
```

The following pipeline scripts (in `test/run*.py`) are used under the hood to run the corresponding models listed in the table below:
| Script | Model(s) |
|--------|----------|
| run_sd.py | SD 1.5, SD Turbo |
| run_sd_xl.py | SDXL Base, SDXL Turbo, Segmind-Vega |
| run_sd3.py | SD3 Medium, SD3.5 Medium (text-to-image and ControlNet) |
| run_sd3_dynamic.py | SD3 / SD3.5 with dynamic shape support |
| run_sd15_controlnet.py | SD 1.5 ControlNet (Canny) |
| run_sd3_controlnet_outpainting.py | SD3 / SD3.5 Outpainting, Removal, Inpainting |

Most pipeline-specific option are passed via the `extra_args` list in the yaml file. Not all options are supported yet, but most are.

The **best** way to become familiar with the available parameters is to examine the [config/pipeline_configs.yaml](config/pipeline_configs.yaml) file. 


**3. Pipeline Groups**

For convenience, you can organize pipelines into **groups** for common workflows. A pipeline group is created by creating a unique group name and listing the desired pipelines under that group in the YAML file. 

For example, the `all_sdxl` tests all SDXL models:

```yaml
  all_sdxl:
    - sdxl_base
    - sdxl_turbo
    - sdxl_turbo_bs1
```

To run this pipeline group, you can run with the `--pipeline_groups` command as follows:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipeline_groups all_sdxl
```

You can also create your own pipeline groups by modifying the YAML file under `pipeline_groups` to specify which pipelines you would like to run:

```yaml
pipeline_groups:
  my_custom_pipeline_group: #group identifier
    - sd_turbo
    - sdxl_turbo
```

#### JSON Files
Each JSON file contains an array of text prompts passed sequentially to pipelines for batch testing. The example JSON files can be found here:
- [config/artistic_prompts.json](config/artistic_prompts.json), [config/anime_prompts.json](config/artistic_prompts.json), [config/alt_prompts.json](config/alt_prompts.json) - Themed prompt collections
<!---- [config/debug_prompt.json](config/debug_prompt.json) - Single prompt for testing -->
- `custom_prompts.json` - Your own custom prompt file
You can pass your own list of prompts with the `--prompt_file` argument. For example:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipelines sd_15 --prompt_file custom_prompts.json
```

## ▶️ Running Pipelines

Pipelines are run by invoking the [scripts/run_pipelines.py](scripts/run_pipelines.py) with the desired pipeline or pipeline group specified. For example, we can run the `sd_15` pipeline with:

```powershell
python /scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipelines sd_15
```

Or we can run the `all` pipelines group with: 

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipeline_groups all
```

A full list of pipeline parameters and their descriptions can be found by running `--help` on the main script:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --help
```

### Execution Modes

The framework supports 3 execution modes to balance speed and performance measurement. 

1. Quick Test Mode (default) - Balanced mode with one warmup iteration followed by one profiled generation, producing two images while capturing basic performance metrics for quick evaluation.

```powershell
# Test SDXL Turbo with basic performance metrics
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --pipelines sdxl_turbo --prompt "a serene mountain landscape"
```
*Output: 2 images (1 warmup + 1 profiled), basic timing statistics*

2. Image-Only Mode (`--image-only`) - Fastest execution for batch image generation with zero warmup and one generation pass, producing a single image per prompt without any profiling overhead.

```powershell
# Generate 5 images from artistic_prompts.json using SDXL Base, no profiling
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --image-only --pipelines sdxl_base --prompt_file config/anime_prompts.json

```
*Output: 5 images total (the anime_prompts.json file contains 5 prompts), 0 warmup rounds, no performance metrics*

3. Benchmark Mode (`--benchmark`) - Comprehensive profiling with one warmup iteration followed by ten profiled generations, producing eleven images total with detailed timing statistics for thorough performance analysis.

```powershell
# Benchmark SDXL with detailed profiling across all SDXL models
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --benchmark --pipeline_groups all_sdxl
```
*Output: 11 images per pipeline (1 warmup + 10 profiled), detailed performance report with timing averages and standard deviations*

### Argument priority 

The framework support argument priorities based on the following order (highest to lowest): 
1. Command-line arguments
2. Pipeline-specific YAML config
3. Global YAML defaults
4. Script-level defaults

### Pipeline Options

The following are framework-level options that can be passed at the command line, or set in the YAML configuration file. Please **read** this carefully as it describes all of the available options for running pipelines. You can run the `--help` argument to get the same information at the command line:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipelines.py --help
```

## 📤 Output

When running [scripts/run_pipelines.py](scripts/run_pipelines.py), the outputs are images and result text files in specific locations with organized naming conventions.

### Generated Images

Images by default can be found in `test/generated_images/`. Filenames include model name, resolution, number of steps, image index, and timestamp (e.g., `test/generated_images/stable-diffusion-v1-5_0_512x512_steps20_idx0_20251124_101132.png`).

> **Note:** You can use the `--clean-images` flag to remove all existing images from the `generated_images` folder before running any pipelines. 

### Results Text Files

Results files can be found in `results/` directory (e.g., `results/pipeline_results_quick_20251124_100116.txt`). They contain execution status (success/failure), duration, timing data, model information, resolution, and error messages for all pipelines run in a session.

> **Note:** You can disable the generation of summary files by using the `--no-summary` flag when running the main script. You can also use the `--clean-results` flag to remove all existing result files from the `results` folder before running any pipelines.

### Log Files

You can choose to save all lines printed to the console at runtime with the`--save-log` flag when running the main script. Log files are saved in the `results/` directory and contain the complete console output from all pipeline executions, including detailed progress messages, warnings, and debug information (eg., `results\pipeline_log_quick_20251124_102713.txt`).

### Benchmark Files

When using the benchmarking mode (`--benchmark`), the results text file includes the benchmarking information (e.g., `results/pipeline_results_benchmark_20251124_102713.txt`). 

After creating the `pipeline_results_benchmark_*.txt` files, you can run the [scripts/process_benchmark_results.py](scripts/process_benchmark_results.py) script to extract benchmark data. This CSV can be imported into Excel for performance analysis and comparison. To generate the CSV file, simply run:

```powershell
python scripts/process_benchmark_results.py
```

And you should get an output of CSV files (e.g., `benchmark_summary_20251124_104406.csv`) with an output similar to:

```csv
Model Name,Resolution,Inference Steps,NPU Models Load Time (s),All Models Load Time (s),1st Gen Pipeline Time (s),Avg Pipeline Time (s),NPU Memory Usage (MB),Total Memory Usage (MB)
SD 1.5 Pipeline,512x512,20,3.898902,3.899352,5.979673,5.978549,1527.36,4412.52
